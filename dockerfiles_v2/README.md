# How to build and run the Spark dashboard in a container image

## How to run
Run the dashboard using a container image from [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lucacanali/spark-dashboard):
- There are a few ports needed and multiple options on how to expose them
- Port 2003 is for Graphite ingestion, port 3000 is for Grafana, port 8428 is used internally by VictoriaMetrics source
- You can expose the ports from the container individually or just make `network=host`.
- Examples:
```
docker run --network=host -d lucacanali/spark-dashboard
or
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 2003:2003 -d lucacanali/spark-dashboard
or
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 2003:2003 -p 8428:8428 -d lucacanali/spark-dashboard
```

## Persisting VictoriaMetrics Data Across Restarts
By default, VictoriaMetrics does not retain data between container restartsâ€”each time the container starts, it begins with an empty dataset. 
To preserve historical metrics, you need to mount a persistent volume for data storage.

Below is an example of how to do this using a local directory:

```
# Create a directory to store VictoriaMetrics data
mkdir metrics_data

# Run the container with the local directory mounted as the data volume.
# This ensures your metrics history survives container restarts.
docker run --network=host \
  -v ./metrics_data:/victoria-metrics-data \
  -d lucacanali/spark-dashboard:v02
```

## Example of how to build the image:
```
cd dockerfiles_v2
docker build -t spark-dashboard:v02 .
```
